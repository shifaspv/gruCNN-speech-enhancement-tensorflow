# gruCNN-SE: A fully recurrent feature extraction for speech enhancement  (Under construction)
This is a Tensorflow implementation of the ```gruCNN-SE``` architecture suggested in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.05233"> this paper</a>, where we build a recurrent feature extraction approach to model speech recurrency at the feature extraction stage itself. 
This is advantageous as the model can capture the locall recurrency pattern of the speech, contrasting to the traditional recurrency modelling  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2018/02/ZhaoZararTashevLee_ICASSP_2018.pdf">[1]</a>, <a href="https://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~wang.77/papers/Tan-Wang1.interspeech18.pdf">[2]</a> , where the recurrency being modelled independtly from the front-end feature extraction. This is an inital attempt towards building higher models motivated from this startegy.

Few samples from the trained model are displayed <a href="https://www.csd.uoc.gr/~shifaspv/IEEE_Letter-demo">here</a>, along with the other models.

## Brief description of the model architecture

As can be seen in the figure, the ```gruCNN-SE``` is a feature domain enhancement model that takes the noisy spectra as the input and extracts features recurrenctly over time. To better understand the exact layer wise details please refer to our paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/submit/3217566/view">at here</a> .

## Implemented On
Python - 3.6.8 <br>
Tensorflow - 1.14.0 <br>

We required few more very common Python packages, check the ```required.txt``` file and install if you don't have.
## Data set
The model displayed on the paper was trained on the manually created data set with clean speech from <a href="https://datashare.is.ed.ac.uk/handle/10283/1942">here</a>. You may download the the clean and noisy speech from there, and extract them to ```./data/NSDTSEA``` directory. 

Then, generate the lists of wave files ID for training and tessting using the ```./data/generate_wave_id_list.py```, and confirm that the names matches to the ones in ```./config/config_params.json```

## Description of the ```./config/config_params.json``` file variables

  <tr>
    <th>"Name"</th>
    <th>"Discription"</th>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <th>train_id_list:</th>
      <td>list of training wave files ID</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <th>valid_id_list:</th>
      <td>list of validation files ID</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>num_gruCNN_layers</th>
    <td>numbering of gruCNN layers employed</td>

    <th>fft_bin_size</th>
    <td>size of the FFT window</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>num_input_frames</th>

  </tr>
    <tr>
    <th>filter_size_gruCNN</th>
    <td>size of gruCNN kernals </td>

</table>

The **train_id_list** and **valid_id_list** are generated by ```./data/generate_wave_id_list.py``` file.
## Training the model

Go to the ```./src``` folder and run the ```train.py``` or copy the command below to command line 

```
python train.py
```

Optionally, you can resume the training that could not have been completed, by passing the second argument ```model_id```

```
python train.py --model_id=saved_model_id
```

Trained models will be saved to the ```./saved_models``` directory

## Testing the model

Once you have trained a model,
Go to the ```./src``` folder, and compile the ```generate.sh``` file with first argument as the ```model_id```. 

```
./generate.sh saved_model_id
```

A new folder named ```./outputs/saved_model_id``` will be created and saved the output sample.
User can manually edit the wave file ID inside the ```generate.sh```, to generate over multiple files.
